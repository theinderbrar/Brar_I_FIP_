This is the final integrated project for the multimedia authoring and the web development program.
The website is about a beer brand .i.e, Dos Guard.
It contains five pages; Home, About, Products, Advertisements, and contact.
There is little interaction in every page but in the products section you can click on the bottles images to get the more information about the product.
