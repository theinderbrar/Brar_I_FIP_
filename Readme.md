This is the final integrated project for the multimedia authoring and the web development program.
The website is about a beer brand .i.e, Dos Guard.
It contains five pages; Home, About, Products, Advertisements, and contact.
There is little interaction in every page but in the products section you can click on the bottles images to get the more information about the product.
Moreover, you can fill up the form to contact the brand and also to get additional information on such as the new updates from the brand.
